This is an experimental repository based on the fact that currently upstream there is no packaging of [[https://frippery.org/busybox/][busybox64a]] and busybox64u that we could understand. This repository was created by using [[https://github.com/microsoft/winget-create][microsoft/winget-create]] and using the =wingetcreate new= wizard to create the YAMLs.

Currently there are multiple solutions for [[https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs/blob/master/doc/README.md#authoring-a-manifest][authoring a manifest]]:
